Hi there!

With this code, you can encrypt and decrypt data in the MS Visual Studio console, as well as do it through a file. 
To do this via a file, create a text document in the project directory and name it as "открытый текст.txt". 
Then write the plaintext into this file and save the file, named as "открытый текст.txt".

The comments in the code are written in Russian. Also, for the correct display of all characters in the console, you must use Windows 1251 encoding.

If you have any questions, ask me please!

Enjoy! 
                                                                                                                                                                                        ABSOLUTE CINEMA
